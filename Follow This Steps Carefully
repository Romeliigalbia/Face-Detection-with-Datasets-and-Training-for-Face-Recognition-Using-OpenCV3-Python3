Follow the steps carefully

1.  Install Anaconda2 32/64 python 2 
    or 
    Install Anaconda3 32/64 python 3

    It Depends on System Information
    Along the way you must check all the options ignore the red text

    Then wait till installation completed ...

    Open CMD admin when finish installed

    Make sure that the anaconda-python is configured in CMD admin 

2.  Type: python

    This will come out:
    C:\WINDOWS\system32>python Python 3.6.3 |Anaconda custom (64-bit)| (default, Oct 15 2017, 03:27:45) 
    [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
